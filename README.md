# Explore the Deep Learning Models with Extrasensory Dataset
[The ExtraSensory Dataset](http://extrasensory.ucsd.edu/)  

From this data set, our plan is to explore feature selection method among all provided features (225 features), and different methods including MLP(Multi Layer Perceptron), RNN(Recurrent Neural Network) and Classic Machine Learning method(Random Forest) to get better performance in classifying multi-label.
